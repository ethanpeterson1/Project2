Almost! your processor completed the program with  2/3 allowed mismatches

Helpful resources for Debugging:
temp/modelsim_dump.txt : output from the VHDL testbench during program execution on your processor
temp/mars_dump.txt : output from MARS containing expected output
vsim.wlf: waveform file generated by processor simulation, you can display this simulation in ModelSim without resimulating your processor by hand
